# Hi, I'm Denz.

I'm a Research Software Engineer specialising in **mobile health**, **sensor data pipelines**, and **simulation/optimization tools**.

I build research-grade software that bridges **science**, **data**, and **real-world applications**, ranging from deploying iOS/Android mHealth apps to designing transport simulation algorithms and researcher tooling.

## Most recent projects I've worked on:

### **LightUP — Mobile Health Platform for Light Exposure**

_Lead Software Engineer (2023–Present)_  
A full-stack mobile intervention app used in multi-institutional studies (NUS & TUM).

- Built with Ionic + Angular
- Wearable integration via ActLumus sensors
- Firebase backend with daily summarizer & audit logging
- ECharts visualisations of circadian light exposure
- Notification, goals, reward systems, diaries

### **CityMoS — City Mobility Simulator**

_Simulation Optimization & Calibration_

- Designed genetic algorithm + Bayesian optimization calibration engine
- Improved realism of traffic demand and driver behavior models
- Worked with transport planners and researchers

<!-- ### **Cooling Singapore 2.0**

_Urban Heat & EV Simulation Tools_

- Implemented mesoscopic EV modelling
- Improved itinerary generation & origin–destination algorithms -->
