# Hi, I'm Denz

I'm a Research Software Engineer specialising in **mobile health**, **sensor data pipelines**, and **simulation and optimization tools**.

I build research-grade software that bridges **science**, **data**, and **real-world applications**, ranging from deploying iOS/Android mHealth apps to designing transport simulation algorithms and researcher tooling.

## Selected projects I’ve contributed to:

### **LightUP — Mobile Health App for Light Exposure**

_Lead Software Engineer (2023–Present)_

LightUP is a mobile health intervention app developed as part of the **LightSPAN** research project, a multi-institutional collaboration between NUS and TUM.

My contributions:

- Led development of the iOS/Android application using Ionic + Angular
- Integrated wearable light-sensing data from ActLumus devices
- Built Firebase-backed daily summarisation and audit logging pipelines
- Implemented light exposure visualisations using ECharts
- Designed notification, goal-setting, reward, and diary systems

### **CityMoS — City Mobility Simulation Software**

#### _Software Engineer for Simulation Optimisation & Calibration_

CityMoS is a city-scale, agent-based mobility simulation platform developed at TUMCREATE and the MoVES Laboratory, used for urban mobility research and planning in academia and industry.

My contributions:

- Designed a calibration engine using genetic algorithms and Bayesian optimisation
- Improved realism of traffic demand and driver behaviour models
- Collaborated with transport planners and researchers on scenario calibration
