# 👋 Hi, I'm Denz.

I'm a Research Software Engineer specialising in **mobile health**, **sensor data pipelines**, and **simulation/optimization tools**.  
I build research-grade software that bridges **science**, **data**, and **real-world applications**—from deploying iOS/Android mHealth apps to designing transport simulation algorithms and researcher tooling.
