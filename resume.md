## SELECTED PROJECTS

### **LightUP Mobile Health Platform (2023–2025)**

**Lead Software Engineer (iOS & Android)**

- Built a full-stack mobile health app using Ionic + Angular for improving healthy light exposure among older adults and children.
- Designed the Firebase backend architecture: Firestore schema, Storage, Authentication, daily summarizer scripts, data freshness monitoring, and Slack-based error reporting.
- Integrated ActLumus wearable sensors via Condor API, implementing recency logic, wear-time validation, and data ingestion pipelines.
- Developed interactive ECharts visualisations for daily/weekly light exposure, segmented by user-defined morning/day/evening windows.
- Implemented complex rules engines for notifications, diaries, weekly goals, achievements, and user state management.
- Led App Store and Google Play deployment including privacy policy, compliance, and release lifecycle.
- Collaborated closely with NUS and TUM investigators to translate research protocols into robust and scalable software features.

### **CityMoS Calibration Framework (2020)**

- Designed and implemented an optimization-powered calibration mechanism using genetic algorithms and Bayesian optimization.
- Improved realism and accuracy of large-scale transport simulations through automated tuning of traffic demand, driver models, and road capacities.

### **Data Freshness & Research Dashboard (2024–2025)**

- Developed a Streamlit dashboard for monitoring study data flow, device recency, and participant engagement.
- Implemented automated categorisation (“Need to Nudge” vs “No Need”), and researcher-facing heuristics for data quality decisions.
